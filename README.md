## 📝 Schema

The project uses a JSON schema to validate quiz data structures:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": { 
      "type": "string" 
    },
    "description": { 
      "type": "string" 
    },
    "questions": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "text": { "type": "string" },
          "options": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": { "type": "string" }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This schema ensures your quiz data is properly structured with a name, description, and questions with multiple-choice options.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your quiz in action!

## 📋 Create Your Own Quiz

1. Create a new JSON file in the `public` directory
2. Follow the schema structure (see existing examples in `public/data.json` and `public/solidity.json`)
3. Update your app to load your custom quiz data

## 🚢 Deployment

### Vercel (Easiest Method)

1. Push your repository to GitHub
2. Visit [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign up or login
3. Click "New Project" and import your repository
4. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and apply the correct build settings
5. Click "Deploy" and your quiz will be live in seconds

### Netlify

### Manual Build and Deploy

#### Static Export (For any static hosting)

1. Build the static site:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. The `out` directory will contain all static files for deployment
3. Upload the contents of the `out` directory to your web hosting service

#### Test Locally

Test your static build locally before deployment:
```bash
npx serve out
```

#### Hosting on Your Own Server

1. Upload all files from the `out` directory to your web server
2. Configure your web server to:
   - Serve `index.html` for the root path
   - Set proper MIME types for JavaScript and CSS files
   - (Optional) Configure caching headers for static assets
